    "Description: These search algorithms are for multi-robot pathfinding, featuring robots A and B navigating a grid with obstacles, with each robot limited to a set of certain coordinated moves. The program employs DFS, BFS, uniform cost search, greedy search, and A* search algorithms, exploring efficient and strategic pathfinding."

However, if there are a large number of obstacles in between the two robots, it won't take that into account when searching for a path, nor the cost of the path.
