# Artificial Intelligence Algorithms Demo

## Search Algorithms Comparisons

**Description:**

This Jupyter notebook explores search algorithms for multi-robot pathfinding, featuring robots A and B navigating a grid with obstacles. Each robot is limited to a set of specific coordinated moves. The program employs DFS, BFS, Uniform Cost Search, Greedy Search, and A* Search algorithms, exploring efficient and strategic pathfinding.

## Minimax Tree & Alpha-Beta Pruning Comparisons

**Description:**

This Jupyter notebook creates a minimax tree to assess the efficiency of the alpha-beta pruning algorithm compared to the standard minimax. It then analyzes and compares these algorithms for a deeper understanding of their performance.
